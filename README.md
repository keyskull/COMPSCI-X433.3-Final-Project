## Project: Voice Analysis

## Participants:  Jialin Li(Cullen), Alexa Huang

## Project Objective:
- This project intended to analyze the speech audio files, using the specific packages such as NumPy, Scipy, and Pylab for plotting data to analyze audio file.
- Throught our learning about the audio data we did Up-Sampling, Down-Sampling to the audio data, and plotting data in Amplitude, Sound level(dB), and the specgram for the audio data.
